- Script & ruleset by Ken Cheng, version 5.2.4

### Version 3.0.3

- vote history; add a line under each night
- Add Trouble With Violets to the list of scripts

### Version 3.0.2

- Minor fix to the point vote sync feature.
- Revised reveal logic and add cliff-hanger paired reveal.
- Added dramatic pair-reveals when applicable.
- Added a visual affect when Evil players are revealed.
- Added some tools to quickly start a dev session.

### Version 3.0.1
- Added reveal for the true character tokens, such as Drunk, Marionette, etc.
- Removed the Exit Presentation button and other minor fixes.
- Added a special Good win reveal, so the dead Demon is revealed second to last.

### Version 3.0.0
- Added a Storyteller Victory reveal screen & grimoire reveal!
- Victory Screen System — Full Implementation

-- Delivers a complete end-to-end victory flow using authentic grimoire
-- visuals and a structured ST workflow.

- ST workflow:
-- ST declares victory → celebration plays for everyone; ST joins the town
-- ST dismisses → returned to Victory Modal to review/adjust alignments and select winners
-- ST clicks Reveal Grimoire → synchronized reveal plays for all clients simultaneously
-- Any client can dismiss their own reveal screen independently

### Version 2.25.2
- Added a button for the Storyteller and players to toggle the alignment of players.

- Good/Evil Alignment Toggle (new feature)
-- Seated players and the Storyteller can now privately annotate player alignment during a game.

- Storyteller view
-- A small circle button appears on each player token (top-right, matching the Night Order circle sizing and responsive scaling).
-- Clicking cycles alignment: Townsfolk/Outsider toggle evil → null; Minion/Demon toggle good → null; Traveler cycles good → evil → null.
-- A colour overlay (mix-blend-mode: color) tints the token blue (good) or red (evil).
-- ST alignment state is stored in Vuex and not transmitted via socket.

- Seated player view
-- Alignment buttons are visible on all player tokens — clicking records a private, local-only annotation for that token.
-- Annotations are stored in localStorage keyed by localAlignment_{playerId}_{targetPlayerId} — never transmitted through the socket.
-- Own token button is always visible; other tokens' buttons appear only when annotated (good/evil set), or on hover when neutral.
-- When a seated player has annotated their own token, the radiant pulsing glow behind their character token overrides the team colour: good → townsfolk blue, evil → demon red.

- Raise-hand button
-- The clickable raise-hand circle is hidden for seated players on other players' tokens.
-- The raised-hand image itself remains visible across all clients when a player raises their hand.
-- The ST can still click the button on behalf of any player.

- Build / Cross-platform Fix
-- Added cross-env devDependency so NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider works on Windows without NODE_OPTIONS syntax errors.

- Bug Fixes:
-- String.substr() → String.slice() (deprecation) in socket.js.
-- Night Order circles and raise-hand emote raised to z-index: 5 to render above the alignment colour overlay.
-- Player context menu z-index: 50 — no longer drops behind other player tokens on hover.
-- TownSquare.vue emote em raised to z-index: 5.
-- Alignment button responsive sizing added to media.scss at <1200px and <992px breakpoints, matching the Night Order circle dimensions exactly.

### Version 2.25.1
- Fixed: When you toggle to "Show" mode [G], a seated player could not point-vote.
- Set NODE_OPTIONS within packahe.json instead of manually for local builds.

### Version 2.25.2
- New Feature — Seasonal Events System:
-- A single-file toggle system for seasonal themes (e.g. Christmas). Changing one line in src/events.js switches the active event; no other files need editing.
-- To add a future event: add an entry to configs in events.js, place assets in the appropriate subfolder, add a CSS block in App.vue for any new visual overlay, then set ACTIVE_EVENT.
- Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a rare TypeError whenever a player was removed during an active Point Vote
- Deprecated substr replaced with slice
- Fixed idle tab/browser sessions by sending a keepalive message & response ping

## Version 2.0.0
- The project is now available under its own domain: [clocktower.online](https://clocktower.online)
- Added a feature that allows a live session Storyteller to automatically (and safely) distribute assigned
  characters to all players that have claimed a seat, eliminating the need to manually tell every player their role
- Visible "night phase" that can be toggled by the Storyteller
- Voting history added with nomination and vote results
- Optional, audible voting countdown added (featuring an actual clock tower bell!)
- Fabled show up on the Night Order sheet and affect Grimoire night order counters
- Current game state can now be easily exported and imported in the form of a JSON text code
- Voting can be paused and sped up / slowed down in 0.5 second increments by the Storyteller
- Voting terminology changed to "Hand UP" / "Hand DOWN" and iconography updated
- Added meta-data support for custom scripts, that currently supports `name`, `author` and a custom `logo` through a
  `_meta` role (note that a customized logo will not be synced to players in a live session)
- Players can no longer claim seats that are already occupied and only the Storyteller can vacate seats of other players
  (players can still vacate their own seat)
- Characters selected in the bluff window now also show up in the list of reminder tokens
- Homebrew scripts / custom characters no longer automatically load in live sessions, for 2 reasons:
  - the players in a live session have no control over the script that the storyteller loads,
    so a malicious storyteller could load a custom script that contains harmful / inappropriate images
  - some homebrew scripts are quite big JSON files and synching these through the live session
    server can cause traffic / performance issue easily
  - this change may be reverted in the future when I figure out a way to sync custom characters safely and without
    such a big impact on performance constraints
- Buggy (spamming) live session connections will now be terminated on the server side and display an error message
- Balloonist reminder tokens adjusted
- Live session URLs shortened
- Deus Ex Fiasco and Stormcatcher Fabled added / updated
- Custom Reminder text looks better when there is a lot of text
- added a README for the backend server
